          <p>Here’s a riff on doing freelance/contract data wrangling work:</p>

<p>You get a windows into esoteric fields and businesses</p>

<p>You can work with people across the country, world</p>

<p>With each new project you’re starting a new relationship.</p>

<p>There’s a necessary. Communication standards need to be reinvented (messenger apps, style, register/formality, etc.)</p>

<p>Dictate the wolf, be the professional here. Make</p>

<p>They often assume maintenance will be included.</p>

<p>For one-off budgets, you’re</p>

<p>My approach to data science is this.
My approach to working with new clients is this.</p>

<p>Fundamental project questions 
One minute of Q/A with a client could potentially save you 10 minutes of coding later</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What’s the big picture? Where does this solution fit into the larger business scope?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the data analysis for internal business intel or is it client facing? How sexy does the visualization need to look?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are you using this tool? Why do you need to know</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This line of questioning will usually yield two types of useful information: they’re using a tool for a very good reason that you should know about, or they’re using the tool for a bad reason that you can help illucidate</p>

<ol>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<p>If it’s not part of a service/product, visuals can be de-emphasized</p>

<p>Data questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Will the form/structure of the data change from the example set that was given? If so, how?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What data is acceptable &gt; What data is unacceptable
Easier to account for</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>CSV
Type issues. Numbers as Strings. Spaces in 
use Contains rather than == operator</p>

<p>White-lists
Budgeting:</p>

<p>The “right way” from a data science perspective is not always the best way from a wide angle lens. Budget, time-frame, and user-experience are important factors.</p>
